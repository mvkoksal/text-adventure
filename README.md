# CSC 207: Text Adventure - Escape the Bunker
*A text-based adventure game*

**Author**: Meryem Koksal

## Overview
You wake up trapped in an underground bunker with no memory of how you got there. Your goal is simple: **escape before it’s too late**.

The bunker contains three interconnected rooms filled with clues, items, and hidden details. You must explore, inspect objects, collect items, and use them in the right places to unlock doors and progress.

Be careful - the bunker is silent, but not empty, and time is not on your side.
